### Hospital Database utilizing Microsoft SQL Server.

Implemented a simplified hospital database comprising 14 related tables to store data about patients, including their allergies, diagnoses, medications, doctors,
past and future appointments, departments, addresses, and a patient portal containing hashed passwords used for logging into the hospital portal. 
The project also involved populating the database with sample data to test its functionality.
